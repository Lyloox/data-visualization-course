    "Now that you have the basis of data manipulation and analysis, it's time to introduce you to Machine Learning algorithms!\n",

    "In data science, we do not use the terms `rows` and `columns` to refer to a dataset. \n",
    "* The rows are called **samples**. For example, in our dataset of US States, each line describing a State is a sample.\n",
    "* The columns are called **features**. Each feature describe a particular aspect of the sample. In the US States dataset, the State id, the State name, and the Geometry were all features. In other datasets (with different samples), it could have been the length of a sentence, the frequency of a word, the number of legs of an animal, a creation date, a GPS location, a True/False boolean...\n",
