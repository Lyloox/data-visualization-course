    "# Kaggle Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle is one of the most known data science community. It's a place to learn, share and compete with other data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work is to **compete** for Housing Price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join the competiton here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaderboard is calculated on your MAE score. The least your error, the best your place on the leaderboard!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, I help you create the model, predict values from the given test_set and create a submission for Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "1. Download at least `train.csv` and `test.csv` data from Kaggle\n",
    "1. Move it to this folder\n",
    "1. Run this code as it is\n",
    "1. Submit your first `submission.csv` to the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your job is to make the best model you can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on Kaggle, you can only upload 5 submissions per day, so **start early**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "* Return this Notebook with the code for your best model\n",
    "    - Explain step by step what you did to improve your model and why, what worked and what did not.\n",
    "    - Write your observations.\n",
    "    - Feel free to give your MAE at each improvement step.\n",
    "    - You can show code for your older model if you find it meaningful, but try to keep it minimum.\n",
    "* Join within this Notebook **your username on Kaggle, and a screenshot of your place in the leaderboard**.\n",
    "* Send your work to my inbox laure.daumal@ext.devinci.fr\n",
    "* **Deadline**: Wednesday, 22nd of April, 23h42.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to\n",
    "1. Clear all outputs before saving & sending it to me (**Cell >> All Output >> Clear**).\n",
    "* Restart the kernel and run all cells to check no errors are found (**Cell >> Run All**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "* Select the best features - Use **feature selection**!\n",
    "* You know how to visualize data - it can be useful to use it.\n",
    "* You will get bonus points for each interesting thing you do in this Notebook. Show me what you learnt. There is a lot of things we saw in the last Notebooks that you can re-use. For example:\n",
    "    - Handle missing values\n",
    "    - Conversion from categorical-string to numerical\n",
    "    - Normalize data (StandardScaler)\n",
    "    - Heatmaps (if some features are highly correlated, keep only one)\n",
    "    - Use dimensionality reduction (keep those with highest eigenvalues)\n",
    "    - Try different models\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "* The higher your place in the leaderboard, the more your grade.\n",
    "* You need to be able to explain your work. Using the solution from another person won't do the trick."
