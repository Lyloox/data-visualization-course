    "\n",
    "The title is self-explanatory. *Teach me something I don't know.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "* Use the [Pokémon Go dataset](https://we.tl/t-Ji9vz9Y93A).\n",
    "* Use **matplotlib**, **(geo)pandas** and other librairies we saw in the last courses. (Don't make me download new ones)\n",
    "* You should display at least **five** different plots.\n",
    "* At least **three** of them should be based on **geolocation**.\n",
    "* Make it *beautiful*. Very simple plots are not enough. Put legends, labels, colors, ...\n",
    "* And, of course: use or do something we didn't see in this notebook.\n",
    "* Send your work to my inbox laure.daumal@ext.devinci.fr\n",
    "* **Deadline**: Wednesday, 26th of February, 23h42. You have a bit more than two weeks and a half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to\n",
    "1. Clear all outputs before saving & sending it to me (**Cell >> All Output >> Clear**).\n",
    "* Restart the kernel and run all cells to check no errors are found (**Cell >> Run All**).\n",

    "### Examples / Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Need some inspiration?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find inspiration on internet, for example the [matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html) \n",
    "* 3D Plotting: https://matplotlib.org/gallery/mplot3d/scatter3d.html \n",
    "* Matplotlib animation: https://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html \n",
    "* Vary the map: the Pokémon Go dataset use world-wide locations, you can focus on a specific Continent, Country or Region. You can also show water: seas, lakes, ...\n",
    "* Use non-geolocalisation features (columns) to put in relation unusual correlation and detect patterns. (In 2D or 3D)\n",
